## 1. List Slicing

### What is List Slicing?
List slicing allows you to extract a portion (subset) of a list by specifying start and end positions. It creates a new list containing only the elements you specify.

### Basic Syntax
```python
list_name[start:end]
```
- `start`: Index where slicing begins (inclusive)
- `end`: Index where slicing ends (exclusive - not included)

### Key Concepts and Examples

#### 1.1 Basic Slicing
```python
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']

# Get first 3 players (indices 0, 1, 2)
first_three = players[0:3]
print(first_three)
# Output: ['charles', 'martina', 'michael']

# Get players from index 1 to 4
middle_players = players[1:4]
print(middle_players)
# Output: ['martina', 'michael', 'florence']
```

**Detailed Explanation:**
- `players[0:3]` starts at index 0 and stops before index 3
- The result includes elements at indices 0, 1, and 2
- Index 3 is NOT included in the result

#### 1.2 Omitting Start Index
```python
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']

# Get first 4 players (from beginning to index 4)
first_four = players[:4]
print(first_four)
# Output: ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence']
```

**Explanation:** When you omit the start index, Python automatically starts from the beginning (index 0).

#### 1.3 Omitting End Index
```python
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']

# Get all players from index 2 to the end
from_third = players[2:]
print(from_third)
# Output: ['michael', 'florence', 'eli']
```

**Explanation:** When you omit the end index, Python includes all elements from the start index to the end of the list.

#### 1.4 Negative Indexing in Slices
```python
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']

# Get last 3 players
last_three = players[-3:]
print(last_three)
# Output: ['michael', 'florence', 'eli']
```

**Explanation:** 
- Negative indices count from the end of the list
- `-3` means "third from the end"
- This approach works regardless of list length

#### 1.5 Step Value in Slices
**Note:** You can include a third value to specify step size:
```python
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
every_other = numbers[::2]  # Every 2nd element
print(every_other)
# Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

## 2. Looping Through Slices

### Concept
You can combine slicing with for loops to iterate through only a subset of list elements.

### Example: Looping Through First Three Players
```python
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']

print("Here are the first three players on my team:")
for player in players[:3]:
    print(player.title())
```

**Output:**
```
Here are the first three players on my team:
Charles
Martina
Michael
```

### Detailed Explanation
1. `players[:3]` creates a slice containing the first three elements
2. The for loop iterates through this slice, not the entire list
3. `player.title()` capitalizes the first letter of each name

### Practical Applications
- **Gaming:** Display top 3 scores from a high score list
- **Web Development:** Show limited number of items per page
- **Data Processing:** Process data in chunks of specific sizes

## 3. Copying Lists

### Why Copy Lists?
Sometimes you need to create a new list based on an existing one, where both lists can be modified independently.

### 3.1 Correct Way: Using Slice Copy
```python
# Original example from the text
my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']
friend_foods = my_foods[:]  # Creates a copy

print("My favorite foods are:")
print(my_foods)
print("\nMy friend's favorite foods are:")
print(friend_foods)
```

**Output:**
```
My favorite foods are:
['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']

My friend's favorite foods are:
['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']
```

### 3.2 Proving They're Separate Lists
```python
my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']
friend_foods = my_foods[:]  # Copy using slice

# Add different items to each list
my_foods.append('cannoli')
friend_foods.append('ice cream')

print("My favorite foods are:")
print(my_foods)
print("\nMy friend's favorite foods are:")
print(friend_foods)
```

**Output:**
```
My favorite foods are:
['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'cannoli']

My friend's favorite foods are:
['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'ice cream']
```

### 3.3 Wrong Way: Direct Assignment (Creates Reference)
```python
my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']
friend_foods = my_foods  # This creates a reference, NOT a copy!

my_foods.append('cannoli')
friend_foods.append('ice cream')

print("My favorite foods are:")
print(my_foods)
print("\nMy friend's favorite foods are:")
print(friend_foods)
```

**Output (BOTH lists are identical):**
```
My favorite foods are:
['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'cannoli', 'ice cream']

My friend's favorite foods are:
['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'cannoli', 'ice cream']
```

### Key Difference Explained
- `friend_foods = my_foods[:]` → Creates a **new list** (copy)
- `friend_foods = my_foods` → Creates a **reference** to the same list
- With references, changes to one variable affect the other
- With copies, each list can be modified independently

## 4. Tuples

### What are Tuples?
Tuples are **immutable** lists - collections of items that cannot be changed after creation.

### Key Characteristics
- Use parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`
- Elements cannot be modified, added, or removed
- Can be accessed using index numbers (just like lists)
- Useful for data that should never change

### 4.1 Defining a Tuple
```python
dimensions = (200, 50)  # Parentheses instead of brackets
print(dimensions[0])    # Access first element
print(dimensions[1])    # Access second element
```

**Output:**
```
200
50
```

### 4.2 Immutability Demonstration
```python
dimensions = (200, 50)
dimensions[0] = 250  # This will cause an error!
```

**Error Output:**
```
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

**Explanation:** This error is actually beneficial - it prevents accidental changes to data that should remain constant.

### 4.3 Single Element Tuple
```python
my_tuple = (3,)  # Note the comma! Required for single-element tuples
print(my_tuple)
# Output: (3,)
```

**Important:** The comma is what makes it a tuple, not the parentheses.

### 4.4 Looping Through Tuples
```python
dimensions = (200, 50)
for dimension in dimensions:
    print(dimension)
```

**Output:**
```
200
50
```

### 4.5 Rewriting Tuples (Reassigning the Variable)
```python
# Original tuple
dimensions = (200, 50)
print("Original dimensions:")
for dimension in dimensions:
    print(dimension)

# Assign new tuple to same variable
dimensions = (400, 100)
print("\nModified dimensions:")
for dimension in dimensions:
    print(dimension)
```

**Output:**
```
Original dimensions:
200
50

Modified dimensions:
400
100
```

**Explanation:** While you can't modify a tuple's contents, you can assign a completely new tuple to the variable.

### When to Use Tuples vs Lists
- **Use Tuples:** For data that shouldn't change (coordinates, RGB colors, configuration settings)
- **Use Lists:** For data that needs to be modified (shopping cart items, user lists, game scores)

## 5. Code Styling Guidelines (PEP 8)

### What is PEP 8?
PEP 8 is Python's official style guide that ensures all Python code follows consistent formatting conventions.

### Core Principle
**"Code is read more often than it is written"** - Therefore, prioritize readability over ease of writing.

### 5.1 Indentation Rules
- **Use 4 spaces per indentation level**
- Never mix tabs and spaces
- Configure your editor to insert spaces when you press Tab

**Example:**
```python
# Correct indentation (4 spaces)
for player in players:
    if player.startswith('m'):
        print(player.title())
```

### 5.2 Line Length Guidelines
- **Limit lines to 79 characters** (recommended)
- Comments should be limited to 72 characters
- Some teams use 99 characters as the limit

**Why 79 characters?**
- Allows multiple files to be viewed side-by-side
- Historical compatibility with terminal windows
- Improves readability on various screen sizes

### 5.3 Blank Lines Usage
- Use blank lines to group related parts of your program
- Don't use blank lines excessively
- One blank line between logical sections is usually sufficient

**Example:**
```python
# Build list of players
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael']
players.append('florence')
players.append('eli')

# Process the list
print("Team roster:")
for player in players:
    print(player.title())
```

### 5.4 Additional Guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Follow naming conventions (lowercase with underscores for variables)
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Be consistent with your style throughout the project

## 6. Practice Exercises

### Exercise 4-10: Slices
**Task:** Using one of your programs, add code that prints:
1. The first three items in the list
2. Three items from the middle of the list
3. The last three items in the list

**Example Solution:**
```python
# Sample list
foods = ['pizza', 'burger', 'salad', 'pasta', 'tacos', 'sushi', 'curry']

# First three items
print("The first three items in the list are:")
print(foods[:3])

# Three items from the middle
print("\nThree items from the middle of the list are:")
print(foods[2:5])

# Last three items
print("\nThe last three items in the list are:")
print(foods[-3:])
```

### Exercise 4-11: My Pizzas, Your Pizzas
**Task:** Create two separate pizza lists and prove they're independent.

**Solution:**
```python
# Original pizza list
my_pizzas = ['margherita', 'pepperoni', 'hawaiian']

# Copy the list
friend_pizzas = my_pizzas[:]

# Add different pizzas to each list
my_pizzas.append('veggie')
friend_pizzas.append('meat lovers')

# Prove they're separate lists
print("My favorite pizzas are:")
for pizza in my_pizzas:
    print(f"- {pizza.title()}")

print("\nMy friend's favorite pizzas are:")
for pizza in friend_pizzas:
    print(f"- {pizza.title()}")
```

### Exercise 4-12: More Loops
**Task:** Write for loops to print each list of foods from the foods.py examples.

**Solution:**
```python
my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'cannoli']
friend_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'ice cream']

print("My favorite foods are:")
for food in my_foods:
    print(f"- {food.title()}")

print("\nMy friend's favorite foods are:")
for food in friend_foods:
    print(f"- {food.title()}")
```

### Exercise 4-13: Buffet
**Task:** Work with a tuple of buffet foods.

**Solution:**
```python
# Original menu (tuple)
buffet_foods = ('rice', 'chicken', 'salad', 'bread', 'soup')

print("Original buffet menu:")
for food in buffet_foods:
    print(f"- {food.title()}")

# Try to modify (this will cause an error)
# buffet_foods[0] = 'pasta'  # Uncomment to see the error

# Change menu by reassigning the tuple
buffet_foods = ('pasta', 'fish', 'salad', 'garlic bread', 'soup')

print("\nRevised buffet menu:")
for food in buffet_foods:
    print(f"- {food.title()}")
```

### Exercise 4-14: PEP 8 Research
**Task:** Read the original PEP 8 style guide at https://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

**Key takeaways to focus on:**
- Naming conventions
- Indentation standards
- Line length recommendations
- When to use blank lines
- Comment formatting

### Exercise 4-15: Code Review
**Task:** Review and modify three of your programs to comply with PEP 8.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Use 4 spaces for indentation
- [ ] Keep lines under 80 characters
- [ ] Use appropriate blank lines
- [ ] Follow naming conventions
- [ ] Add meaningful comments where needed
