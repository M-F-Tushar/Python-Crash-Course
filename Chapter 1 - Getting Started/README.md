## 1. Introduction

In this chapter, you'll create and run your first Python program called `hello_world.py`. The chapter covers:
- Checking for Python installation
- Installing Python if needed
- Setting up a text editor
- Understanding Python code structure through syntax highlighting

**Key Concept**: Text editors recognize Python code and highlight different sections, making it easier to understand your code's structure.

---

## 2. Setting Up Your Programming Environment

### Why Environment Setup Matters
Python behaves slightly differently across operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), so proper setup ensures your code runs consistently regardless of platform.

### What You'll Need
1. **Python 3.6 or later** - The programming language itself
2. **Text Editor** (Sublime Text recommended) - For writing and running code

---

## 3. Python Versions

### Current Recommendations
- **Latest Version**: Python 3.7 (as of the book's writing)
- **Minimum Required**: Python 3.6 or later
- **Avoid**: Python 2.x (deprecated and unsupported)

### Version Compatibility
- Everything in the book works with Python 3.6+
- Python 2 may still exist on your system (for legacy support) - leave it alone
- Always use Python 3 for new projects

### Why Python 3?
- More powerful and versatile than Python 2
- Active development and security updates
- Better Unicode support
- Improved syntax and functionality

---

## 4. Running Python Code Snippets

### Interactive Python Interpreter
The Python interpreter allows you to test code snippets without creating full programs.

#### Example: Basic Interpreter Usage
```python
>>> print("Hello Python interpreter!")
Hello Python interpreter!
```

**Code Breakdown**:
- `>>>` - Python interpreter prompt (indicates you're in interactive mode)
- `print()` - Built-in function that displays text
- `"Hello Python interpreter!"` - String literal (text data)
- The output appears immediately below your input

#### When to Use Snippets vs Programs
- **Snippets**: Quick testing, learning basic concepts, experimenting with syntax
- **Programs**: Complete applications, saving work for later, sharing with others

### Hello World Tradition
Creating a "Hello World!" program is a programming tradition that:
- Tests your development environment
- Ensures your setup works correctly
- Brings good luck to programmers (traditional belief)
- Serves as a foundation - if this works, more complex programs should too
